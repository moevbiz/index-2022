# Independent Space Index 2022
June 24-26, 2022
12-7pm

Viennese project spaces jointly invite to a city-wide Open House event. On Saturday and Sunday, June 25 and 26, from 12pm until 7pm, all listed spaces have extended their opening hours and you can visit them without an appointment.

In addition to this open house program, a total of {{ collections.events.length }} special events are hosted on occasion of the festival.

Featuring ongoing exhibitions in {{ collections.locations.length }} spaces all over town, the festival was conceived as an open assemblage of initiatives revealing the vibrancy, complexity and diversity of Vienna's independent art scene. Visitors are invited to join the parcours and discover this richness across the city.
