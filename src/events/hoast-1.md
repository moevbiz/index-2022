Made in China invites you to attend our happening Washing and Drinking. Exhibition will take place in hoast artist–run space Vienna during the Independent Space Index Festival between June 24th to June 27th. Come and enjoy, as the mildest form of alcoholism meets the mildest form of masochism, with amateur cocktail enthusiasts Viktor, Jara and Marko and washing artisans Vasja and Žiga.

Bring ONE OR MORE PIECES OF DIRTY LAUNDRY with you, which we will wash / turn into a work of art before your eyes!

We will perform on Friday 7—10 pm and on Saturday and Sunday from 3—6 pm.

Music by: Tehno Muda
