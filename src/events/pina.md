The exhibition at Salzburger Kunstverein prominently features a life-size model of the sous-terrain exhibition space in Vienna, contrasting the dimensions of the two Kunstvereins by inserting one into the other. Constructed from specially designed steel modules, this display structure will be used as a framework to the artworks included in the show.
