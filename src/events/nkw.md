An early discussion at an Independent Space Index Stammtisch led to a proposal that Vienna’s independent scene could be considered a large and diverse intergenerational institution, presenting hundreds of exhibitions and projects per year, creating a responsive web of international networks. Questions about the role of these small collaborative cultural initiatives run parallel to those of valuation of individual artistic effort. This gives us a clue to what the ‘mission’ of such a decentralized institution might be. What should strategies of re-presentation be, whether it be through festivals, joint exhibitions, institutional invitations, or historical analysis?

Independent Synergies invites international artists, artist initiated, and independent projects to Vienna to exchange experiences, to meet and network with active members of our local scene, and to introduce independent artistic activity that takes place in contexts outside of our own.
