title: MEMENTO MEMORY – Raimund Pleschberger, Ukrike Königshofer

How does a seemingly immaterial meaning, an aura, arise in a banal piece of matter – as Walter Benjamin describes it? What forms of staging are required for this? In which social context are they integrated? The exhibition poses questions about the uniqueness and significance of objects in our institutional or private culture of remembrance - be they museum works of art, church relics or private family photos.
