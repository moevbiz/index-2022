    THE TOBACCO FILES
    Laëtitia Badaut Haussmann
---
The Tobacco Files is an iconographic research led through the imagery of tobacco and the representation of cigarettes and smokers in the 20th and 21st centuries, from glamour and emancipation to gore pseudo-medical imagery. The work consists of 20 folders –many of which include cigarette ads featured in Playboy (from 1952 to 2003), amongst other sources such as cinema, adverts and online imagery.

Laëtitia Badaut Haussmann’s artistic works revolve around the notion of para-architecture. Her research is situated at the intersection of several fields including domesticity, psychology and feminism. Her practice is centered around the concept of design and its history as a social and political expression. She works with sculpture, installation, image, text, video, sound; the exhibition being her main medium.
Her work has been the subject of several solo and group shows, most recent include: Campoli Presti (2022, Paris, France), Ikon Gallery (2022, Birmingham, UK), Musée d’Art Moderne (2021, Paris, France), A Tale of A Tub (2021, Rotterdam, The Netherlands), Centre Pompidou (2020, Paris, France), Beeler Gallery (2020, Columbus, Ohio, USA), MACRO (2020, Rome, Italy) and many more.
