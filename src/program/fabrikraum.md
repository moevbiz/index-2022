Soft ParadeÂ is a group exhibition which brings together Michel Aniol, Meike Kuhnert, Eva Funk and Joshua Zielinski to Fabrikraum. The four independent artists, who are all based in Berlin, had the ambition to engage with the exhibition space and create new works dealing with the specific conditions of this place and its local context.
