Kevin Space is pleased to present Sitcom Architecture, the first solo exhibition by artist and writer Becket MWN in Austria. Through a site-specific installation of text-based audio, sculpture, and video, the exhibition expands on the artistâ€™s interests in the relation between acts of speaking, media, and contemporary productions of subjectivity.

Unfolding from the specificities of the two almost identical rooms of Kevin Space, Sitcom Architecture explores the dimensions of the double on an architectural, medial, embodied, and psychological level, while reflecting on how narratives are constructed, and experiences of being present are mediated, through staging and the formative act of editing. Stage and backstage, on and off camera, interior and exterior constitute doubtful distinctions in the creation of ambiguous spaces and characters and serve the exploration of the fragmented domestic and political realms of the present.
