title: Sveta Mordovskaya - Assholes

Kevin Space is pleased to present Assholes, the first solo exhibition of the Zurich-based artist Sveta Mordovskaya in Austria. This exhibition extends Mordovskaya’s pursuits in confronting codes, concepts and conventions of the everyday through a subjective, yet sociological and next to taxonomical attitude towards material properties, objects and language. Upheaving familiar perspectives that sediment into fragmented and increasingly contradictious realities, Assholes poetically, humorously and critically approaches the individual and society’s treatments of uncomfortable emotions leading to projections and conflicts.
