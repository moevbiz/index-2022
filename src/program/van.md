Born in London, she is British-Bangladeshi, lives and works in Vienna.

Brishty Alam works knowingly with slippages between scientific models (chemical structure, natural history specimens) and what we might call social, cultural, political or economic processes. She reanimates these models in unexpected contexts, looking at shape, dimensionality, material and transcultural semiotics through her sculptural investigations. In between states of transition, her work exists on an axis of continued reaction.– Edited extracts from ‘If we are to hold water’ by Miriam Stoney
