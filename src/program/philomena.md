Sixth Tone is an experiment seeking to work through dialogue and peer-to-peer exchange in the process of exhibition making.

During a series of group meetings, carried out over six months, four artists and two curators assembled to question identity, belonging and the concept of "home". The artists, coming from various cultures and nationalities, reflected on their hybrid identities, characterised as a fluid form that internalises the negotiation and processing of different cultural perspectives. It implies that a person may feel equally belonging to two or more cultural spaces. These hybrid identities are considered inter-, trans- and multicultural; their bearers are bi-native, bi-national or tri-national; they either sit between the chairs, or on a third chair; at times, they don’t experience multiplicity but rather a contradiction, when the two cultures that form their identity do not coincide. The meetings offered a communal exercise in intimacy and vulnerability in a safe space devoted to debate, disagreement and listening. 
At philomena+, the group will present individual works alongside glimpses from their dialogue through responses and reflections on each other's artworks.
