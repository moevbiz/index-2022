Pina is hosting a group exhibition of drawings by Viennese artists.

The exhibition is a continuation of a multi-part exhibition series on social spaces and the relationships between "off-space" and institution.

During the opening night and in the course of the summer, the show will be expanded by spontaneous sketches, doodles and graphics on paper.
