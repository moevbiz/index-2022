Pina is hosting a group exhibition of drawings by Viennese artists.

The exhibition is the second part of "Café Heaven", a multi-part exhibition series on social spaces and the relationships between "off-space" and institution. (https://www.pinavienna.eu/exhibitions/cafe-heaven-at-salzburger-kunstverein) 

For the first part, a 1:1 model of Pina made of steel modules was installed at Salzburger Kunstverein. Parts of the installation will be used as a display for the exhibited works in the upcoming show in Vienna. 

During the opening night and in the course of the summer, the compilation will be expanded by spontaneous sketches, doodles and graphics on paper.
