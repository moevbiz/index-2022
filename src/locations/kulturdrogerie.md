The Kulturdrogerie association, located in a former drugstore on Gentzgasse 86-88 in Vienna’s 18th district, Währing, makes studio space, production space, and exhibition and presentation area available to selected, invited artists.

The association was founded in 2005 by sculptors Markus Hiesleitner and Franz Tišek. Kulturdrogerie is an experimental art space that functions as an ideational testing ground, and provides artists with support and space that they otherwise would not have at their disposal to realise their projects. The Kulturdrogerie thus views its purpose as a place of production and exhibition for contemporary young art.
