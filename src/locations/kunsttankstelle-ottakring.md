In 2007, the KUNSTTANKSTELLE OTTAKRING was founded in memory of the Dichter family (www.sammlungdichter.com) by the artists Roland and Richard Sch√ºtz (co-founder of MASC FOUNDATION). The former gas station was available as a precariat for exhibitions until 2014. In 2014 the KUNSTTANKSTELLE OTTAKRING was saved for artists all year round for presentations, lectures, exhibitions, low budget productions.
