Kevin Space is a Vienna based Kunstverein and was founded by Fanny Hauser, Carolina Nöbauer, Denise Helene Sumi and Franziska Sophie Wildförster in 2016. Kevin Space promotes international and local developments of contemporary visual arts, brought into dialogue in solo and group exhibitions as well as performative and discursive formats. A focus on the commission of new artistic productions, developed on site and conceived specifically for the space, and the close work with the artists invited test out the potential of the art space as a dynamic space of encounter.
