Salon für Kunstbuch. An Artwork as Enterprise
Bernhard Cella/ artist, curator and publisher is interested in current forms of visual art that change production and distribution models. In 2007 he founded "Salon für Kunstbuch" in Vienna, a company as artwork that combines his academic and publishing practice with temporary performative settings, exhibitions, and discourse formats, and with which he investigates the economic and sculptural frameworks within which artists' books are conceived, produced, and distributed. He built a 1:1 scale model space in his studio in Vienna 2007-17 and at the Belvedere 21/2011-19, linking bookshop, archive, exhibition and discourse space with his own studio to create a living transitive network space.
