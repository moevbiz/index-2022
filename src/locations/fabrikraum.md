Kultur und Kunstverein FABRIKRAUM is a non-profit cultural association, which is based in Vienna. It was founded by a group of artists and cultural managers in 2018. The collective aims to create a platform that artists, curators, and researchers can introduce their works to each other and collaborate on different projects. We organize non-profit art and cultural events such as workshops, seminars, lectures, exhibitions, public interventions, fairs, artist talks, and discussions. We embrace all levels of artistic research with a special focus on multidisciplinary approaches and new media art.
