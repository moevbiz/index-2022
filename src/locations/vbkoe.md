The VBKÃ– is a 112-year-old association for wom*n artists. Today it exists as a space  that fosters contemporary feminist artistic agendas, offers a space for experiments and promotes political and activist work to establish a new and vital connection between historical debates and contemporary queer, feminist art production.
